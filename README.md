Corona SDK Template
-------------------

A template for Corona SDK with a clear file structure to help you get started on your projects faster.

## Suggestions

1. Place all user-created modules under `com/yourname/`.
1. Organize your files by scene. For each scene, create a folder under `scenes/`. Under that folder, place other folders for scene-specific files, such as `scenes/menu/fonts/`.
1. For files shared between all scenes, place them under `scenes/shared/`.
